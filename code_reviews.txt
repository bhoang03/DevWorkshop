	Similarities: Both emphasize respectful and effective communication. Both also emphasize smaller reviews, which lighten the burden on everyone and is just more effective. Both also mandate a response to all feedback.
	Differences: Microsoft uses an Emoji code to emphasize a certain tone, while Yelp implies in-person meetings that convey intent better. Yelp has a process of picking reviewers and having a primary reviewer, while Microsoft does not have such a process.

This is a good code review because it focuses on the flaws of the code rather than the developer. It also provides a very detailed analysis of the problem and provides extensive guidelines on how to fix it.

This review is not very beneficial as it primarily covers things not relevant to the code itself.
Telling the person they're proud of them using spacing and parameters, when such a trivial component and not what was asked for, feels almost condecending.
I would have kept the review shorter, to keep the focus on its actual functionality and not the asthetics of the code.
