This review is not very beneficial as it primarily covers things not relevant to the code itself.
Telling the person they're proud of them using spacing and parameters, when such a trivial component and not what was asked for, feels almost condecending.
I would have kept the review shorter, to keep the focus on its actual functionality and not the asthetics of the code.
